    <h4 class="text-centerd">About</h4>
        <p class="text-centerd"> My name is Linnéa Thuresson. I'm 26 years old and come from a small village called Älmhult.<br>
          I started my studies at UX- Desig, at EC education in august 2021 and will be finished in 2023. I'm most interested of prototyping but I'm very curious on all the aspects of UX. I want to learn everything you can offer. 
          I moved to Malmö for 4 years ago. I have a full-time job at the IKEA Malmö store. During my studies I'm on leave, but I still work every other weekend. My main department is Livingroom where sofas, bookshelf's/tv benches and workspace are included.
          I have broad assignment which includes being responsible over bookshelf's and tv-benches. Which means that I'm used to have a close collaboration with our home furniture experts, most of them only speak English so I'm used to speak much English at work. Together we implement news or when we need to do bigger changes or do a rebuilding the different departments that they have to be a part of. In my area of responsibility, I also make sure that all the range with end sales date, get sold in time, keeping the department in perfect shape to keep it inspiring. I also have been responsible for the forecast on the range at the Livingroom department. 
          
            <br>In addition to this the focus is helping and serving customers to meet their expectations, keeping our department in shape as new by making it inspiring and showing the right furniture's. 
            I also have competence at home textile/ bed textiles and have helped logistic picking orders for the customers and unpacking. 
            
            I always meet the customer and my colleagues with a smile on my face and I feel very appreciated at my work. My ambition is to always leave a smile on their faces too. 
            
            I would love to keep develop and learn new things, broadening my understanding and competence within UX-Design.
